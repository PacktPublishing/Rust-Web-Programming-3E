## Running the server

You can run the Actix server with the command below:
```
cargo run -p to-do-actix-server
```

You can run the Axum server with the command below:
```
cargo run -p to-do-axum-server
```
You can run the Rocket server with the command below:
```
cargo run -p to-do-rocket-server
```
We can see with the Rocket example that logging is already configured. Rocket is basically a “batteries included” framework where things like logging are already setup.

You can run the Hyper server with the command below:
```
cargo run -p to-do-hyper-server
```
